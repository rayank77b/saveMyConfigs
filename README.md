save My Configs is a python script, which log in per ssh on switch/server/etc and save config in git
something similar like Rancid, but it has no WEB UI.

I use Gitblit (http://gitblit.com/) and use the Web Interface of Gitblit to look for changes.

describe here, how config work
(at moment see smc.conf.example)
